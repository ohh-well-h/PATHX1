# PathX App - Final Working Icons

## ✅ **ALL ICON ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **Final Working Icon Set:**
After multiple attempts, we found the minimal set of Material icons that work:

| Feature | Icon | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Dashboard | `Icons.Filled.Home` | ✅ Working |
| Planner | `Icons.Filled.List` | ✅ Working |
| Projects | `Icons.Filled.Star` | ✅ Working |
| Reading | `Icons.Filled.Star` | ✅ Working |
| Journal | `Icons.Filled.Edit` | ✅ Working |

### **Icon Logic:**
- 🏠 **Home** - Perfect for Dashboard
- 📋 **List** - Perfect for Planner/Tasks
- ⭐ **Star** - Used for both Projects and Reading (represents favorites/importance)
- ✏️ **Edit** - Perfect for Journal

### **Why This Works:**
- These are the most basic Material icons
- They are guaranteed to exist in any Android SDK version
- While not perfectly semantic, they provide visual distinction
- The app functionality is not affected by icon choice
